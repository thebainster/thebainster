- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game developed in java as my first programming project. Its a game I played as a kid
      My friends had video games but I didnt. I would paly it when it rained. I would dodge th water dripping off the roof edge
      with my hand. I thought it would make an interesting video game.
